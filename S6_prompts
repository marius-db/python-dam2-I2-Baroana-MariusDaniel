create me a code that is like a simulation of a game store in which i want to be able to: insert, modify and eliminate products which are stored in a dictionary with the following information: Their name, price and how many we have in stock. then i wanna be able to calculate the total value of my inventory in the store, see which is the most expensive item i have in this inventory for sale and also see the average per item i spend from all products. I want you to use for loops to go tho the items dictionary and i want you to not use any imports and use simple beginner friendly code. I also would like you to structure the code in functions to keep a clean view for it and also make sure you take care of all possible errors/exceptions that could happen in any place of the code. I then also want you to add comments where you seem fit explaining most of the code and also try to add quality of life features where you seem fit like for example a confirmation text before adding an item to the dictionary/inventory in which it shows you all information you entered previously and then asks if everything is correct and if you say yes it proceeds to add the item to the inventory and if not it cancels the action and puts you back at the main menu. Also i forgot but for when the user modifies the items in the inventory i want them to be able to change how many are there in stock, their prices, and their name but like not all at once, but they can choose what information about that item they want to change. Also let's say this game store has not only games and consoles but also merchanise of games and animes like plushies or clothing or figurines or etc.

okei, the code seems to be looking good. i want you to add like 10 items in the inventory by default taking into account the theme of this store and what i mentioned before about it and for a personal touch of this exercise i want to add the ability of an option that when used it simulates a day of sales for this shop and then shows your profits or loses and other cool information like that. I also want you to add another option in which shows your different providers which have different items and you can use your money to buy these items and then sell them in your store and they of course get added automatically in the inventory when you buy them and keeps track of the stock, this most likely will basically use the add_item function to add new items and if you buy an existing item you already have registered in the inventory to resupply it it most likely will use the modify_item function to update the information of that item which would be basically only the stock number. I also want you to add the name of the providers for each of the items in the inventory and that information is automatically set for each item depending on which provider sells them to you and also i want you to make it so with modify item the user is only allowed to change the price and stock number and not the name and i don't want them to be able to add new items by themselves, instead new items are added ONLY when you buy them for a provider. Now before doing all that i need you to remember this needs to be beginner friendly code so no imports, leave comments explaining the code where you see fit and take care of all possible errors/exceptions that could happen.

okei okei it looks great so far. now i want you to fix some of the text that is outdated that shows in the menu like for example it still says choose from options 1-8. i also want you to make the exit be if you write the number 0 instead of 8. i then want you to add 10 items to each providers and also add two new providers, one with hololive merch which alongside whatever also has gawr gura merch like figurines or plushies or clothing and then Good Smile Company which has most figurines, figmas and whatever else they have which i can obtain, including Megumin figurines. Also add new providers and items as the old ones i don't really like. Now about some quality of life features: i want you to add a cool looking asci art that also says "Welcome to GameStore simulator" at the beginning with press enter to continue which then sends you to the menu. i also want you to make it so everytime after you select an option in the menu, do whatever you do with it and then you are about to be sent to the menu again, right before that i want you to make it so the user gets sent back to the menu only after they press enter so it makes it easy for them to see the result instead of the result being pushed up by the menu. of course again, remember to keep it beginner friendly with no imports, comment the code when needed to explain it and take care of possible errors/exceptions
